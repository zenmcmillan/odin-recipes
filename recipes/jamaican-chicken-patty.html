        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon of turmeric, 1 teaspoon of paprika, 1 teaspoon of cumin, and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Stir to mix.</li>
            <li>In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup of cold water and 1/2 cup of cold milk. Add the liquid to the dry ingredients and stir until a dough forms.
                Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Flatten each ball into a circle about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>    
            <li>In a large saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add 1 minced onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent.</li>   
            <li>Stir in 1/2 cup of chicken stock, 2 minced charred green chilis, 1 tablespoon of yellow curry, 1 teaspoon of coriander, 1 teaspoon of dried thyme, 1/2 teaspoon of allspice, 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of paprika.</li>        
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1 pound of ground chicken and cook until the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped parsley. Season with salt and white pepper to taste.
                Let the filling cool for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the filling cool for a few minutes.</li> 
            <li>Place about 1/2 cup of the filling onto one half of each dough circle. Brush the edges of the dough with beaten egg. Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape, and press the edges to seal.</li>       
            <li>Place the patties on a baking sheet and brush the tops with more beaten egg.</li>    
            <li>Bake the patties for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
